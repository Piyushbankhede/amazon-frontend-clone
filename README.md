## Overview

The Amazon Frontend Clone project leverages Terraform to provision AWS EC2 instances, replicating the infrastructure required to host the frontend application. Jenkins is used for continuous integration and deployment, while Trivy and OWASP help ensure container and application security. Docker is utilized for containerization, Git for version control, and SonarQube for code quality analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code tool used to provision AWS resources.
- **AWS EC2**: Virtual servers in the AWS cloud used to host the frontend application.
- **Jenkins**: Automation server used for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanner for containers, used to ensure container security.
- **OWASP**: Open Web Application Security Project, used for application security testing.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies.
- **Git**: Version control system used for collaboration and version management.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis tool used to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
